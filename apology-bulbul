        <h1>I'm Sorry, My Love</h1>
        <p>
            My dearest <span class="highlight">ARICA</span>,<br><br>
            I know that words can't take away the pain I've caused, but I want you to know that I am truly sorry from the bottom of my heart. The things I said were thoughtless and hurtful, and I understand how much trust I've broken. I never meant to hurt you or make you feel less than the incredible person you are. Please believe me when I say that hurting you is the last thing I would ever want to do.<br><br>

            I want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world, and I will do everything in my power to rebuild the trust I've broken. My actions were wrong, and I will work hard to make things right. I hope that over time, you can see the sincerity in my heart and the depth of my regret.<br><br>

            Please know that I am here for you whenever you're ready to talk, and I will always be ready to listen. You mean everything to me, and I never want to take you for granted again.<br><br>

            With all my love and deepest apologies,<br>
            <span class="signature">BUBBLE</span>
